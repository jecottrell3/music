<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>
Genre/Subgenre/Artist/Album/Track
</p><p>
Most likely there won't be a Track file, and the Album itself will be a File
instead of a Directory.

There may be links to Wikipedia (or other) articles.

Similar Artists have been grouped together. For example, any album by Crosby,
Stills, Nash, or Young are grouped with CSNY. Cream is grouped with Clapton.
Count Basie and Duke Ellington are grouped somewhat amusingly as
"Count Duku", because they either play together or one plays the other.

<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>
Pigeonholing. I originally had Leo Kottke and John Fahey in with Blugrass,
and Michael Hedges in with Jazz. But Kottke and Hedges are more like
each other than their categories. I'll probably throw them in with the
Windham Hill New Age stuff.
