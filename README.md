## Organization

Entries are listed in the following format: 
**Genre/Subgenre/Artist/Album/Track**

Most likely there won't be a Track file, and the Album itself will be a File
instead of a Directory. In a Perfect World, the Track would contain an actual
playable Sound File, but the Copyright Boogeyman would get me.

There may be links to Wikipedia (or other) articles or the info embedded
in the files themselves. This would work well for the Leaf Nodes, but not
the internal Directories. Perhaps another `README.md` file or maybe
`ARTIST.md`. I haven't decided entirely what to do yet.

This is hosted on Github, which doesn't seem to display HTML, so the
documentation is in *Markdown* format. If nothing else, I'll get practice
using that. There is a Markdown Plugin for Firefox, and probably one
for Chrome if it's not already builtin.

## Grouping

Similar Artists have been grouped together. For example, any album by
Crosby, Stills, Nash, or Young are grouped with CSNY. Cream is grouped
with Clapton.  Count Basie and Duke Ellington are grouped somewhat
amusingly as "Count Duku", because they either play together or one
plays othe other's music.

## Notation

Because these items are stores as Files, I avoid Spaces and most Special
Characters. Some sequences I made up, such as **%**, which is a standin for
the sequence " of ". I considered using **~** as a standin for the Artist's
name (perhaps I'll go back and use **...** or **@**), but I've generally
left the name out, so you will see titles like `Plays (somewhere)` or
`The Incredible`. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

## Classification

Ahhh....Pigeonholing.
I originally had Leo Kottke and John Fahey in with Blugrass,
and Michael Hedges in with Jazz. But Kottke and Hedges are more like
each other than either of their categories. I'll probably throw them in
with the Windham Hill New Age stuff.
